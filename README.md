# Airoha firmware parser & decryptor

An _010 Editor_ template for parsing the Airoha firmware format, and a Python script for decrypting the firmware's encrypted part.

Products using this firmware format include the AirReps (an AirPods clone) and numerous Sony headphones (notably WH-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM5, whose MediaTek chips are rebranded Airoha chips. Additional models may be found in [this](https://github.com/lzghzr/MDR_Proxy) repository).

The only plaintext strings present in the firmware are "verion string" (Sony) and "version string" (AirReps).

## Parser usage

Simply load the template in 010 Editor and run it on your firmware file.

To produce the parser I've analyzed most firmware fields by hand, until I've found out that an Airoha evaluation kit is [publicly available](https://github.com/haltsai/Airoha_AB1565EVK) and used it to complete the analysis.

## Decryptor usage

**Note â€“ The decryption algorithm hasn't been tested, and is simply based on the mentioned evaluation kit.**  
An example of encrypted firmware with a known key and IV would be most helpful.

To decrypt, run:

```bash
pip install -Ur requirements.txt

python airoha_decrypt.py --key=0F0E0D0C0B0A09080706050403020100 --iv=63373832646334633039386336366362 --from=fw.encrypted --offset=0x1000 --to=fw.decrypted --verify-lzma
```

Explanation:

- `--offset` specifies the offset in the input file where the encrypted part starts. (Optional)
- `--verify-lzma` verifies that the decrypted file is a valid LZMA file. This is effectively equivalent to checking that the key and IV were correct. (Optional)
